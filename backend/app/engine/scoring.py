"""Scoring Engine - plain Python, deterministic (no LLM). Configurable, explainable job-fit score.

An ATS-inspired model built from documented, general techniques (weighted skill matching, required vs preferred
criteria, evidence-based match values, eligibility kept separate from the score). It does NOT reproduce any
company's proprietary scoring, and the weights below are our own starting assumptions to be validated.

    S = wK*K + wJ*J + wE*E + wQ*Q + wA*A          (each component is 0-100; weights come from the chosen profile)

    K  skills match            weighted match of requirements, required vs preferred blended by `pref_share`
    J  responsibility fit      do your projects/roles show comparable work (not just the same tools)
    E  relevant experience     min(1, years you have / years the job asks for)  - only when both are known
    Q  evidence quality        0.40*directness + 0.35*ownership + 0.25*verifiability of your bullets
    A  education               match of education requirements (or credit for a verified degree)

If a component cannot be scored (e.g. years unknown) its weight is redistributed to the others and the report says so.
