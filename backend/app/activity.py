"""Live agent activity feed (per user, in memory).

Every agent / tool step wraps its work in `step(uid, agent, tech)`. The frontend polls /api/activity and shows
which agent is working right now, on which technology, and how long recent steps took. It reports what really ran:
nothing here is simulated.
